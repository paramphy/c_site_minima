## Problem in section "Preparing a Data file and Plotting" no. 4
Write a program in C++ to tabulate the values of X(t) and Y(t):
$$X(t) = r(t)cos(t)$$
$$Y(t) = r(t)sin(t)$$
$$r(t) = e^{cos(t)}-2cos(4t)+sin^5(\frac{t}{12})$$
at the equally spaced time intervals $\delta t$ for $-T<=t<=T$, where $\delta t$ and $T$ are to be treated as inputs. Plot $X(t)$ vs. $Y(t)$.
