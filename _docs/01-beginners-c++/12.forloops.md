In this tutorial, we will learn about the C++ for loop and its working with the help of some examples.

In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.

For example, let's say we want to show a message 100 times. Then instead of writing the print statement 100 times, we can use a loop.

That was just a simple example; we can achieve much more efficiency and sophistication in our programs by making effective use of loops.

There are 3 types of loops in C++.

- **for loop**
- **while loop**
- **do...while loop**

This tutorial focuses on C++ for loop. We will learn about the other type of loops in the upcoming tutorials.
## C++ for loop

The syntax of for-loop is:
```c++
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // body of-loop 
}
```
Here,

- initialization - initializes variables and is executed only once
- condition - if true, the body of for loop is executed
    if false, the for loop is terminated
- update - updates the value of initialized variables and again checks the condition

To learn more about conditions, check out our tutorial on C++ Relational and Logical Operators.

### Example 1: Printing Numbers From 1 to 5
```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
1 2 3 4 5
```
Here is how this program works

|Iteration|	Variable|i <= 5|Action|
|-------|-----|-----|----|
|1st|	i = 1|	true|1 is printed. i is increased to 2.|
|2nd|	i = 2|	true|2 is printed. i is increased to 3.|
|3rd|	i = 3|	true|3 is printed. i is increased to 4.|
|4th|	i = 4|	true|4 is printed. i is increased to 5.|
|5th|	i = 5|	true|5 is printed. i is increased to 6.|
|6th|	i = 6|	false|The loop is terminated|
			
### Example 2: Display a text 5 times
```c++
// C++ Program to display a text 5 times

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; ++i) {
        cout <<  "Hello World! " << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Output
```
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
```
Here is how this program works
|Iteration|	Variable|i <= 5|Action|
|----|----|----|----|
|1st|	i = 1|		true|Hello World! is printed and i is increased to 2.|
|2nd|	i = 2|	true|Hello World! is printed and i is increased to 3.|			
|3rd|	i = 3|	true|Hello World! is printed and i is increased to 4.|			
|4th|	i = 4|	true|Hello World! is printed and i is increased to 5.|			
|5th|	i = 5|	true|Hello World! is printed and i is increased to 6.|
|6th|	i = 6|	false|The loop is terminated|

			
### Example 3: Find the sum of first n Natural Numbers
```c++
// C++ program to find the sum of first n natural numbers
// positive integers such as 1,2,3,...n are known as natural numbers

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num, sum;
    sum = 0;

    cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
    cin >> num;

    for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i) {
        sum += i;
    }

    cout << "Sum = " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Output
```
Enter a positive integer: 10
Sum = 55
```
In the above example, we have two variables num and sum. The sum variable is assigned with 0 and the num variable is assigned with the value provided by the user.

Note that we have used a for loop.
```c++
for(int i = 1; i <= num; ++i)
```
Here,

- int i = 1: initializes the i variable
- i <= num: runs the loop as long as i is less than or equal to num
- ++i: increases the i variable by 1 in each iteration

When i becomes 11, the condition is false and sum will be equal to 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 10.
Ranged Based for Loop

In C++11, a new range-based for loop was introduced to work with collections such as arrays and vectors. Its syntax is:
```c++
for (variable : collection) {
    // body of loop
}
```

Here, for every value in the collection, the for loop is executed and the value is assigned to the variable.
### Example 4: Range Based for Loop
```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  
    int num_array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
  
    for (int n : num_array) {
        cout << n << " ";
    }
  
    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
In the above program, we have declared and initialized an int array named num_array. It has 10 items.

Here, we have used a range-based for loop to access all the items in the array.
## C++ Infinite for loop

If the condition in a for loop is always true, it runs forever (until memory is full). For example,
```c++
// infinite for loop
for(int i = 1; i > 0; i++) {
    // block of code
}
```
In the above program, the condition is always true which will then run the code for infinite times.
    
**Note: Use Crtl+c to stop the infinite loop if needed.**
